     * Memory Usage Estimation for a Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; with 100,000 entries:
     *
     * 1. HashMap Object Overhead: This can vary, but let's assume it's about 36 bytes.
     * 2. Array Overhead:
     *    - The array size will be the nearest power of 2 greater than or equal to 100,000 / load factor.
     *    - Assuming a load factor of 0.75, the array size will be 2^17 = 131,072.
     *    - The memory usage will be 131,072 * 4 bytes = 524,288 bytes.
     * 3. Entry Overhead: Each entry has an overhead of about 32 bytes (object header, hash code, and three references).
     * 4. Key Overhead:
     *    - Each key has an overhead of about 36 bytes (object header, length, hash cache) plus the character data.
     *    - Assuming the character data is 64 bytes, the total key overhead per entry is 100 bytes.
     * 5. Value Overhead: Each Integer object has an overhead of about 16 bytes (object header plus int value).
     *
     * Total Memory Usage Formula:
     * Total Memory Usage = HashMap Object Overhead + Array Overhead +
     *                      (Entry Overhead + Key Overhead + Value Overhead) * Number of Entries
     *
     * Plugging in the numbers:
     * Total Memory Usage = 36 + 524,288 + (32 + 100 + 16) * 100,000
     *                    ≈ 14,965 kilobytes (≈ 15 MB)
     *
     * Note:
     * This estimation is quite simplistic and the actual memory usage may be different based on the JVM implementation,
     * the actual Map implementation being used, and other factors.
