## OpenSearch Anomaly Detection

The OpenSearch Anomaly Detection plugin enables you to leverage Machine Learning based algorithms to automatically detect anomalies as your log data is ingested. Combined with [OpenSearch Alerting](https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting), you can monitor your data in near real time and automatically send alert notifications . With an intuitive OpenSearch Dashboards interface, and a powerful API, it is easy to set up, tune, and monitor your anomaly detectors.

Anomaly detection is using the [Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm](https://github.com/aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws) for detecting anomalous data points.

Anomaly detections run a scheduled job using [job-scheduler](https://github.com/opensearch-project/job-scheduler).

You can use this plugin with the same version of the [OpenSearch Alerting Plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting) to create monitors based on created anomaly detectors. A scheduled monitor run checks the anomaly detection results regularly, and collects anomalies to trigger alerts based on custom trigger conditions.
